This is the material for the 2015 EDSD course "Visualizing Data with `ggplot`". Within the sub-folder `lesson` you find the annotated code we wrote during the lectures. I added some additional examples. Things we have only implicitly covered are coordinates (`coord`) and statistics (`stat`). I added a "Cookbook Statistics" `R` script demonstrating some common features of the statistical transformations in `ggplot`.

Just as a reminder, this is what we covered in class:

I. Introduction

  - introducing `ggplot` and the grammar of graphics
  - basic plots in `ggplot`
  - geometries (`geom`) and aesthetics (`aes`)

II. Data

  - introducing *tidy* data
  - getting data into tidy format using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

III. Scales I

  - knowing your data, knowing your scales
  - each aesthetic has it's scale
  - scale transformations
  - manual labelling of scales

IV. Scales II

  - colour scales (qualitative, sequential, divergent)
  - continuous versus discrete
  - Lexis Maps

V. Multivariate Visualization

  - we apply all of `gplot` to analyse a more complex dataset
