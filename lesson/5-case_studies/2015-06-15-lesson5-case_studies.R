#'## Case Study 1. The Fukushima Nuclear Disaster.

#' During the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 private individuals streamed
#' their Geiger counter readings via webcam to the internet. This dataset
#' contains readings from some of these web-streams over time. Note that these
#' are not official readings but readings provided by private individuals.

#'## Guardian: The Counted

#' The problem with these density maps is that they don't adjust for different
#' populations sizes in the different regions and therefore just show the
#' geographical population-distribution in the United States. A strategy to show
#' the number of killed standardized by population size is to calculate
#' population-specific event-proportions and show the result as a

#' and geographic information about the borders of the US state (a shapefile).
