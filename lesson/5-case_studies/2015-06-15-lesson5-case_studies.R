#'## Case Study 1. The Fukushima Nuclear Disaster.

#' During the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 private individuals streamed
#' their Geiger counter readings via webcam to the internet. This dataset
#' contains readings from some of these web-streams over time. Note that these
#' are not official readings but readings provided by private individuals.
