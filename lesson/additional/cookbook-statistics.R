#' This document is supposed to give you some starting points for using
#' statistical transformations in ggplot. It is not complete in any way, nor is
#' it written in a didactic style. It is a cookbook, a collection of basic
#' recipes.

library(ggplot2)   # our plotting package
library(tidyr)     # for reshaping between wide and long format
library(dplyr)     # for general data transformation

#'## Smoothing Lines

#' It is straightforward to add a smoothing line to a scatterplot.
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

#' We can change the degree of smoothing (only for loess method).
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(span = 10, colour = "red")

#' We can change the method of smoothin to "linear model".
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#' We can change the model formula.
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x))

#' The smoothing also works groupwise if we specify groups. Note, that groupwise
#' smoothing only works for discrete variables (e.g. factors).
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Ozone, y = Wind, colour = as.factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

#'## Summarising Data

#' Bin your data into categories (tabularise it) and plot the results as a
#' dotplot. Note: `..count..` is an internal ggplot variable. It was produced by
#' applying `stat_bin` (see `help("stat_bin")`) to our `diamonds` data and
#' represents the number of cases with a specific `color` in our data. Different
#' statistical transformations return different variables. Internal variables
#' are always surrounded by two dots. We can map them to aesthetics like we would
#' with variables in our data.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = ..count..), stat = "bin")

#' The `geom_bar` uses `stat_bin` as default as therefore produces roughly the
#' same plot without further specifications.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color)) +
  geom_bar()

#' The binning also works for more than a single group.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = ..count.., shape = cut), stat = "bin") +
  geom_line(aes(y = ..count.., group = cut), stat = "bin")

#' Also very useful is `stat_summary`. It allows us to take all unique x or y
#' values and to summarise them in some way. E.g. take the mean of all y values
#' at every unique x and plot it as a line. This can be a good alternative more
#' elaborated smoothing methods.
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean")

#' It also works groupwise.
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean")

#' Densities of 2d data.
ggplot(quakes, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_density2d() +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = ..level..),
               alpha = 0.2,
               stat = "density2d")

#'## Summarising Marginal Distributions

#' Plot marginal densities.
ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist)) +
  geom_density()
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed)) +
  geom_density()

#' Add marginal distribution as "ticks" on axes.
ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist, y = speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_rug()

#' Add marginal means as vertical and horizontal lines.
ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist, y = speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(speed))) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(dist)))

#' Add groupwise marginal means as vertical and horizontal lines.
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = qsec, colour = as.factor(am))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(yintercept = mean, stat = "hline") +
  geom_line(xintercept = mean, stat = "vline")
